## Facilitator Guide: Lesson 7 – "While" and "For": Loops Are Already in Your Brain

---

### Duration
45–60 minutes

---

### Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe a loop as a repeated action
- Explain the difference between a "while" loop and a "for" loop using real-world examples
- Write pseudocode that demonstrates repeated behavior using a loop structure

---

### Facilitator Notes

#### Opening Discussion (5–7 min)
Begin with a welcoming affirmation:
> “I can almost promise that each of you has performed a 'while' or 'for' loop recently.”

Ask:
- “Have you ever taken out the trash one bag at a time?”
- “Have you put on both shoes?”
- “Have you done the same task more than once?”

These examples introduce loops in a relatable way and affirm that students already understand the concept at a subconscious level.

### Concept 1: What Is a Loop? (10–12 min)

**Key Talking Points:**
- A loop is simply doing the same thing more than once.
- We can describe loops using phrases like “for each” or “while there are.”

**Examples:**
- **While loop:** “While there are groceries in the bag, take one out and put it away.”
- **For loop:** “For each suit, sort the cards into a pile.”
- **Extended analogies:**
  - Making toast: “Take a slice out, put it on a plate.” Repeat for each person.
  - Putting on shoes: “For each foot, put on a shoe.”
  - Washing dishes: “While there are still dirty dishes, wash one.”

Let students offer their own loop stories. Validate every contribution—even if it doesn’t perfectly match a programming term yet.

### Activity: Identify and Categorize Loops (15–20 min)

**Materials:**
- Pre-written cards or slips of paper with real-life loop examples
- Sorting table or labeled areas for “while” and “for”

**Instructions:**
- Students sort the example actions into “while” or “for” categories
- Group discussion on edge cases or ambiguous examples

---

### Concept 2: Writing Pseudocode for Loops (10 min)

**Prompt:**
- “Choose a loop example and write out how it works as instructions.”
- Guide them to use plain language: “While there’s more to do...” or “For each item in the bag...”

Let students work individually or in pairs.

---

### Wrap-Up & Reflection (5–7 min)

**Discussion Questions:**
- “What loop did you recognize from your own life?”
- “Was it easier than you expected?”
- “Do you think computers learn by repetition too?”

Encourage students to keep these ideas in mind—they’ll soon apply these concepts in an interpreter.

---

### Final Thought
“Repetition isn’t boring—it’s how we learn. And how we teach the computer.”

**Worksheet Reminder:**
Encourage completion of the “Loop in Real Life” worksheet. Reinforce that documenting the process helps reinforce the concept.
