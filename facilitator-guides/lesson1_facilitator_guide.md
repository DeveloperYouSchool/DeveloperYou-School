**Lesson 1: What Makes a Program a Program?**  
**Level:** Absolute Beginner  

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners should be able to:
- Identify the key components of a program (input, processing, output)
- Describe what makes a program purposeful
- Recognize that programs are planned solutions to problems
- Use everyday scenarios to explain how a computer program works
- Reflect on their understanding and emotional response to the learning process

---

## Materials Needed

- Whiteboard or digital board
- Sticky notes or index cards
- Lesson 1 student worksheet
- Markers or pens

---

## Introduction (5 min)

**Attention Step:**  
Ask the group: “When someone says 'computer program,' what’s the first thing that pops into your head?”

**Overview:**  
This lesson introduces the most basic building blocks of what makes a program. We’ll use familiar, human concepts—input, decisions, output—to help learners feel grounded before encountering any code.

**Motivation:**  
Show learners they already *know* many of these ideas. By tapping into this, we reduce fear and build confidence early.

---

## Facilitation Tips

- Validate all student responses, especially those that use real-world metaphors.
- Draw parallels between daily tasks (like making breakfast or navigating traffic) and basic programs.
- Use humor and humility to reduce anxiety. This is foundational, not evaluative.

## Activities Breakdown

### Activity 1: What's a Program, Really? (15 min)
- Ask students to describe step-by-step how to make toast or find a friend’s house.
- Use their responses to point out input (user action), process (internal decisions), and output (result).
- Introduce the idea that computers don’t “understand,” they execute exactly what they’re told.

### Activity 2: Label the Program Parts (15 min)
- Using sticky notes or printed scenarios, break down simple tasks into input/process/output.
- Small group discussion followed by sharing to the class.

### Reflection Prompt (10 min)
At the bottom of the worksheet, learners respond to:
> “What do you know now that you didn’t before this lesson?”

This models a **git commit**—recording what changed and why it mattered.

---

## Closing & Discussion (5 min)

- Ask: “What surprised you today?”
- Preview next lesson: “We’ll explore how to plan before writing anything. Like talking out loud to figure out what we want.”

---

## Notes for the Facilitator

- This lesson is about confidence, not correctness.
- Be on the lookout for students who say, “I didn’t know that’s what a program was!” That’s your moment to reinforce that they’re already thinking like developers.
