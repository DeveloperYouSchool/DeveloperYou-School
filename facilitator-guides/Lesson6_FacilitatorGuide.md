**Lesson 6: If This, Then What?**  
**Level:** Absolute Beginner  
**Duration:** ~45–60 minutes  
**Modality:** Adaptable for in-person or virtual delivery

---

## Facilitator Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners should be able to:

- Describe cause-and-effect relationships using plain language  
- Create their own IF → THEN logic statements

---

## Pre-Lesson Prep

- Prepare cards or slips of paper for the optional in-person pairing activity  
- Have access to a whiteboard, notepad, or shared doc tool  
- Optionally print worksheet for students to complete (coming next)

---

## Lesson Flow & Guidance

### Introduction (5 min)
**Prompt:**  
Ask: “Have you ever made a different decision because of the weather?”  
Let students share examples. These real-world moments are excellent anchors.

**Key Insight to Reinforce:**  
“We change what we do based on what happens around us. Computers can do the same thing—but only if we give them clear rules.”

---

### Concept 1 – The Core Pattern (10 min)
Present the phrase:  
> “If [something happens], then [I’ll do something about it].”

Guide students through real examples:  
- If it’s raining, then I’ll use an umbrella.  
- If I’m hungry, then I’ll get a snack.  
- If I don’t recognize the phone number, then I won’t answer.

**Facilitator Note:**  
Encourage clarity over perfection. The goal is concept, not syntax.

---

### Concept 2 – Make Your Own IFs (10–15 min)
**Individual or Small Group Activity:**  
Ask students to write 2–3 “if” statements from their lives.  
Then, have them switch papers or cards with someone else and complete the “then.”

**Discussion Prompt:**  
- “Did someone complete your sentence the way you expected?”  
- “Why do you think they answered that way?”

---

### Concept 3 – Real-Life is Full of Decisions (10 min)
Guide a short class brainstorm:  
Ask: “What are some real-world systems that make decisions?”

Example answers:  
- A thermostat (If too cold, then heat up)  
- A traffic light sensor  
- A video app’s autoplay feature

Make it personal and playful where possible.

---

### Wrap-Up & Reflection (5 min)
Ask students:  
- “Where did you use IF → THEN today without realizing it?”  
- “Can you imagine how this might be helpful when talking to a computer?”

---

### Optional Extension (Group Activity)
**For in-person sessions:**  
Each student writes an “IF” on a card. They trade with someone who writes the “THEN.”  
Collect examples and discuss how everyone made different assumptions.

---

## Closing Thought
> “When we give a computer an IF → THEN, we’re not just giving it instructions—we’re teaching it how to make decisions.”
