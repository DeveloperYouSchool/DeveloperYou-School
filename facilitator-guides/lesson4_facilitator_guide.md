# DeveloperYou School – Facilitator Guide
## Lesson 4: “Well, That Didn’t Work...” – Learning from Mistakes

---

### Facilitator Notes

**Lesson Overview:**  
This lesson introduces students to healthy mindsets for dealing with failure and mistakes in problem-solving. Students will explore their options when something doesn’t work and learn how to document their choices and thought processes.

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Recognize that failure is part of the learning process
- Choose an appropriate next step when an approach fails (retry, ask for help, etc.)
- Document a problem-solving path clearly and honestly
- Reflect on how mistakes help develop long-term problem-solving skills

---

## Pre-Lesson Preparation

- Prepare example code snippets with built-in errors or missteps
- Create handouts or slides with a simple decision tree:  
  “That didn’t work. Now what?”
- Optional: real-world examples of famous failures and how they were resolved

---

## Facilitation Flow

### 1. **Introduction (5–7 min)**
- Start with a warm anecdote: “Have you ever had something go wrong, but figured it out later?”
- Emphasize that failure is data. It’s how we learn.

**Discussion prompt:**  
“What do you usually do when something doesn’t work?”

---

### 2. **Main Activity (15–20 min)**

#### Activity: “Try It, Break It, Fix It”

- Present a problem to solve (it can be code-based or procedural)
- Let learners attempt a solution
- When the solution fails (intentionally or naturally), pause and ask:
  - What happened?
  - What are your options now?
  - Would it help to ask a peer, or try again differently?

**Goal:** Help students build decision-making habits for failure points.

---

### 3. **Reflection and Journaling (10 min)**

- Provide writing space or a worksheet prompt:
  “What did you try? Why do you think it didn’t work? What did you try next?”

Encourage honesty, not perfection.

---

### 4. **Wrap-Up (5–7 min)**

**Prompt students:**  
“When something doesn’t work, I can either:  
- Try something else  
- Ask for help  
- Take a break and come back  
What’s your favorite strategy?”

**Callout Quote:**  
“Failure is a detour, not a dead end.”

- Examples of error logs, developer notes, and debugging journals
- Templates for “Failure Journals” students can maintain across lessons
