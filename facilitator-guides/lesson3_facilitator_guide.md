## Facilitator Guide – Lesson 3: Saving the Journey: Messages That Matter

### Target Audience
Absolute beginners in programming and software development

### Lesson Duration
45–60 minutes

---

## Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Describe the purpose of saving progress in a software project
- Use messages to describe what changed and why it matters
- Compare saving in Git to capturing moments in a photo album
- Discuss the value of small, meaningful updates over time

---

## Key Concepts

- **Saving vs. Committing:** Saving is storing progress. A commit is a deliberate snapshot with meaning.
- **Commit Message = Memory Label:** Just like labeling a photo: who, what, when, and why.
- **You Are Not Just a Developer—You're a Storyteller:** You're leaving notes for your future self and your teammates.
- **Version Control Is Communication:** The commit log is your development diary.

---

## Preparation

- Print or distribute student worksheets
- Have sample Git repository screenshots ready (optional)
- Prepare the "scrapbook" metaphor visuals if desired

---

## Introduction (5 min)

**Prompt Discussion:**  
"Have you ever looked at an old photo and thought, 'I have no idea what was happening here'?"  
Introduce the idea that each time we *commit* in Git, we're labeling a moment in our coding journey.

---

## Guided Activity: Photo Album Analogy (10 min)

**Materials:** Index cards or sticky notes.  
Have students describe a moment from their past (e.g., “My 10th birthday party”). Ask them to write a caption they would add under the photo.  
Transition: “A commit message is exactly that—a caption for a moment in your project.”

---

## Concept Teaching: What Makes a Good Message? (10 min)

- Action + Reason = Useful Commit
- “Added login form” vs. “Added login form for beta testing; no password validation yet”

**Whiteboard Examples:**
Bad: `misc fixes`  
Good: `Refactored student input logic to handle empty name fields`

---

## Group Practice: “Tell Me the Story” (15 min)

Give students 3 short code changes (either real or described). Ask them to come up with commit messages.  
Example:  
1. Changed title on homepage  
2. Fixed a typo in “student”  
3. Replaced list with dictionary for better lookup speed

Discuss which commit messages help a teammate—or their future self—understand what changed.

---

## Wrap-Up Reflection (5 min)

Prompt: “How could a well-written message help you next week, or even next year?”

**Git Habit Builder Prompt (on worksheet):**  
> *What is one thing you now know that you didn’t before this lesson?*  
> *Why might it matter to your future self?*

---

## Tips for Facilitators

- Emphasize that small messages accumulate into big understanding.
- Encourage personality in the commit messages—this is a *journal*, not just a log.
- Avoid over-correcting grammar or perfection. Focus on clarity and intention.
- Reassure students: committing is a skill. Like all skills, it improves with practice.

## Preview of Lesson 4

Next time: “That Didn’t Work—Now What?”  
We’ll explore what to do when your idea doesn’t work, and how to build graceful ways to respond.
