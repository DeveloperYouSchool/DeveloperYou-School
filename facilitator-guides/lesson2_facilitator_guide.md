## Facilitator Guide: Lesson 2

**Lesson Title:** Thinking Out Loud: Writing Plans the Computer Can Learn From  
**Level:** Absolute Beginner  
**Duration:** 45–60 minutes

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

- Define pseudocode and explain its purpose in planning software
- Write pseudocode using natural, everyday language
- Decompose a problem into pseudocode steps
- Describe how pseudocode evolves into comments, docstrings, or functions
- Explain how 'talking to yourself' in code makes future work easier

---

## Materials

- Whiteboard or digital drawing tool
- Sticky notes or index cards for modular thinking activity
- Student handouts or pseudocode template (optional)

---

## Facilitation Notes

### Introduction (5 min)
**Prompt the group:**  
“When you try to solve a tough problem, do you ever talk to yourself?”

Explain that today’s goal is learning how to plan a solution using our own words—without writing any code. This planning technique is called **pseudocode**.

---

### What Is Pseudocode? (10 min)
- Pseudocode is **not** code—it’s a way to organize your thinking.
- It’s written in natural language.
- Think of it like notes in the margin or instructions to your future self.

**Demonstrate:**
```plaintext
# Let's ask the user their name
# If they're over 18, let them register
# Otherwise, show a message
```

---

### Natural Language Is Enough (10 min)
- Emphasize clarity over “sounding technical.”
- Pseudocode should feel like explaining something to a friend.
- Use real-world phrasing: “Let’s sort the students by grade.”

**Activity:**  
Assign a small task like “calculate someone’s age.” Ask learners to write a natural-language plan for solving it.

---

### From Thought to Code (10 min)
- Show how pseudocode becomes comments or structure in real code.
- Use an example to demonstrate this transition step-by-step.

---

### Breaking Down Bigger Problems (10 min)
- Take a larger task: “Build a student registration form.”
- Use sticky notes or cards to plan pseudocode in modules.
- Work together to arrange steps logically.

---

### Wrap-Up & Reflection (5 min)
- Ask: “How does this help your thinking?”
- “How would this help you in a team?”
- Introduce the idea that this is a *communication* tool.

**Prompt for Self-Reflection (Git Habit Practice):**  
“Before we move on, describe how your confidence has grown since the beginning of the lesson.”

---

### Key Facilitator Tips
- Validate all pseudocode phrasing that’s clear—even if it doesn’t look “techy.”
- Avoid overcorrecting grammar or technical phrasing.
- Praise thoughtful organization and effort, even if solutions are imperfect.
- Encourage learners to keep and refine their pseudocode in future work.
