## Lesson 5: Variables – The Computer’s Memory

---

### Overview

This lesson introduces students to the concept of variables by drawing a parallel to filling out simple forms. It emphasizes the idea of the computer remembering information and how that memory can be updated or changed.

---

### Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Describe what a variable is using relatable language
- Identify different data types used in programming (e.g., name, age, date)
- Assign values to variables using a classroom paper activity
- Reflect on how variables are updated and reused
- Use simple examples to connect memory and data

---

### Materials Needed

- Printed “Computer Form” worksheet (one per student)
- Whiteboard or digital display
- Marker or sticky notes (optional for group activity)

---

### Key Vocabulary

- **Variable** – A container that holds a value in memory
- **Value** – The actual data being stored (name, number, etc.)
- **Assignment** – Giving a variable a value
- **Update** – Changing the value of a variable

---

### Lesson Walkthrough

#### 1. **Opening Prompt (5 minutes)**

Ask:  
**“When you fill out a form with your name and age, what happens to that information?”**  
- Use this to relate to how a computer stores and recalls data.

Explain:  
A variable is the computer’s way of remembering something, just like writing on a form. Later, it can read it back to you.

---

#### 2. **Concept Introduction (10 minutes)**

- Introduce the idea of variables in plain language: “If I say `name = Jordan`, the computer remembers ‘Jordan’ when I ask for `name`.”
- Explain the types of information: name (text), age (number), date (formatted).

Show examples on a whiteboard or display:

```plaintext
name = "Jordan"
age = 17
```

Then demonstrate:
```plaintext
> name
"Jordan"
> age
17
```

---

#### 3. **Student Activity (15–20 minutes)**

- Hand out the “Computer Form” worksheet
- Let students write in their variable values (name, age, school, etc.)
- Ask them to pair up and “query” each other’s variable names—reading back values

Discussion Prompt:  
**“Does it feel like it would be easy to change a value?”**

Encourage them to write new values next to their old ones. Reinforce that the variable always holds the *latest* value.

---

#### 4. **Extension Activity (Optional, 5–10 minutes)**

- Add a “favorite color” or “today’s mood” field
- Ask students to change their answers and reflect on how it feels to update information.

---

### Closing Thought

Remind students:  
> “Variables are how the computer remembers—and just like us, it can forget or update what it knows.”

Next time, we’ll talk about how to ask the computer to do things with the information it remembers. It’s not magic—just memory and instructions!
