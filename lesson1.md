# Lesson 1: What’s the Problem?

## Objective
Help learners identify a problem in their own life or context that software could help solve — even in a small way.

## Key Concepts
- A computer is a tool — not the solution
- You don’t need code to identify what needs fixing
- We solve problems first — then teach the computer

## Activities
- Discuss everyday annoyances or chores
- Choose one and describe what an ideal solution would *do*
- Write the steps in plain language

## Reflection Prompt
“How is your thinking clearer now than it was at the start of this lesson?”

> Every solution starts with understanding the problem.
