# 📝 Worksheet: The Loop You Already Know

## Part 1: What is a Loop?

A loop is just repeating something **until** it’s done or **for each** item in a list.

Think about your day today. Did you…

- Unpack groceries?
- Sort laundry?
- Clean up your room?
- Feed pets?

If you repeated an action for each item or until nothing was left—you ran a loop!

**Question:**  
Write about one thing you did this week that involved doing the same thing more than once.

> ✏️ _Example: “I folded each piece of laundry and put it away.”_  
> Your turn:  
> ______________________________________________________  
> ______________________________________________________
