## Part 1: Fill Out the Form

Think of this form like the computer‚Äôs memory. Each field is a place where the computer stores information. Fill it out with your real or made-up information.

| Variable Name     | Description                          | Your Value         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `name`            | Your first name                      | __________________ |
| `age`             | Your age in years                    | __________________ |
| `school`          | The name of your school              | __________________ |
| `favorite_color`  | Your favorite color                  | __________________ |
| `has_pet`         | Do you have a pet? (Yes/No)          | __________________ |

## Part 2: Ask the Computer

If you typed each line above into the computer, what would happen if you then typed the word `name` and hit enter?

What would the computer ‚Äúsay‚Äù back to you?  
**Answer:** ________________________________________

Do the same for two more variables:  
- If you typed `age` ‚Üí ______________________________  
- If you typed `favorite_color` ‚Üí ____________________

## Part 3: The Envelope Game

Imagine each of your variables is written on the outside of an envelope. Inside is a slip of paper with the value. You can take it out or replace it at any time.

1. What would happen if you changed the value of `age` from 12 to 13?  
   - **What should the new envelope say inside?** ____________

2. Let‚Äôs pretend your favorite color changes:  
   - **Old value:** __________________  
   - **New value:** __________________  

Write the new line of code to update the color:  
```python
favorite_color = "__________________"
```

## Part 4: Reflection

Why do you think we give our variables **names** instead of just calling them ‚Äúbox1‚Äù, ‚Äúbox2‚Äù, etc.?

If someone else had to read your variable values, how would naming them help?
