# DeveloperYou School: Foundational Lessons

Welcome to DeveloperYou School â€” where learning to code starts with learning to think.

This repository contains the first four foundational lessons of the DeveloperYou School curriculum. These lessons are intentionally designed for absolute beginners and are grounded in the philosophy that learning software development is about more than writing code â€” itâ€™s about learning to solve problems, build confidence, and develop habits that last.

## ðŸ“š Lessons Included
1. **Whatâ€™s the Problem?** â€“ Identifying a solvable software-related issue
2. **Thinking Out Loud** â€“ Writing your thought process before writing code
3. **Saving Your Progress** â€“ Using Git to preserve your learning journey
4. **Talking to Errors** â€“ Learning how to respond when things donâ€™t go as planned

## ðŸ’¡ Who This Is For
This project is meant for:
- Students just starting their coding journey
- Teachers and facilitators seeking beginner-friendly materials
- Mentors and DevRel professionals looking to support a different kind of learner

## ðŸ™Œ How to Use This Repo
Each lesson includes:
- A student-facing outline in markdown
- A facilitator guide (coming soon)
- A reflection prompt to encourage learning retention

You are encouraged to fork, adapt, and build upon this content for non-commercial learning environments. Commercial licensing available upon request.

## ðŸŒ± Our Philosophy
> The student already knows much of what we want them to learn. Our job is to help them discover that.
