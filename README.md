# DeveloperYou School: Foundational Lessons

Welcome to DeveloperYou School — where learning to code starts with learning to think.

This repository contains the first eight foundational lessons of the DeveloperYou School curriculum. These lessons are intentionally designed for absolute beginners and are grounded in the philosophy that learning software development is about more than writing code — it’s about learning to solve problems, build confidence, and develop habits that last.

## 📚 Lessons Included

1. **What Is a Program?** – Exploring what code actually *is* and what it does  
   `lesson1-what-is-a-program.md`

2. **Thinking Out Loud** – Practicing your reasoning before writing your code  
   `lesson2-thinking-out-loud.md`

3. **Snapshots and Milestones** – Using Git to preserve your learning journey  
   `lesson3-snapshots-and-milestones.md`

4. **Well, That Didn’t Work** – Learning how to respond when things go wrong  
   `lesson4-well-that-didnt-work.md`

5. **Say My Name** – Understanding how variables help store and name things  
   `lesson5-say-my-name.md`

6. **If This, Then What?** – Introducing conditionals and simple logic  
   `lesson6_if_this_then_what.md`

7. **Loop, You Know?** – Making code repeat with loops  
   `lesson7_loop_you_know.md`

8. **Why Zero Matters** – Learning how numbers, counting, and indexes work in code  
   `lesson_8_why_zero_matters.md`

## 🌱 Our Philosophy

> The student already knows much of what we want them to learn. Our job is to help them discover that.

DeveloperYou School exists to help learners who’ve been overlooked, underestimated, or told they “just don’t have the brain for it.” We believe anyone can learn to program — with the right support, structure, and a clear path forward.

We don’t just teach code. We teach clarity, confidence, and professional practice.

We believe:
- **Simplicity is a strength** — easy-to-read code is good code  
- **Problem-solving matters more than memorization**  
- **Real-world developer habits should start early**  

Too many developers learn things like version control, commenting, and code review only after being scolded for not knowing. We’re flipping that script by introducing them early — so students don’t just learn how to code, they learn how to *be* developers.

> _“Simple code is strong code.”_  
> This isn’t just our opinion — it’s backed by the very experts who’ve shaped the languages we use.
