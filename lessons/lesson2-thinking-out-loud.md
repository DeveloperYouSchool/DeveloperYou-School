# Lesson 2: Thinking Out Loud – Writing Plans the Computer Can Learn From

**Level:** Absolute Beginner

## Objectives
- Define pseudocode and explain its purpose in planning software
- Write pseudocode using natural, everyday language
- Decompose a problem into pseudocode steps
- Describe how pseudocode evolves into comments, docstrings, or functions
- Explain how 'talking to yourself' in code makes future work easier

## Introduction
Ask learners: “When you try to solve a tough problem, do you ever talk to yourself?”  
Today we’re learning how to plan code using pseudocode—plain language steps we write before writing real code.

## Core Concepts
### What Is Pseudocode?
- Not real code; it’s notes or directions to your future self
- Written in natural language
- Helps you organize your thinking

### Natural Language Is Enough
- It’s okay to write: "Let’s sort our students by grade."
- Clear > Clever

### Thought to Code
- Pseudocode often becomes code comments or docstrings
- You’re shaping your thinking before shaping the code

### Breaking Down a Bigger Problem
- Example: building a student registration form
- Break into blocks using index cards or sticky notes

## Wrap-Up
Reflect on:
- How did pseudocode help?
- Would you use this technique again?

**Progress Prompt:**  
_“What changed in your thinking today? What might your future self thank you for?”_
