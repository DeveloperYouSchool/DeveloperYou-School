# Lesson 1: What Is a Program? ‚Äì Cooking Up Instructions

**Level:** Absolute Beginner

---

## üìò Vocabulary to Discover

Before we name the technical words, here‚Äôs what they *mean* in plain English. You‚Äôll connect the dots later.

- A list of steps to tell your program how to act  
- A subordinate task that your program uses with a list of items required  
- The information (or items) you give to your program or subordinate task  
- The information, or product you receive from your program or subordinate task  
- A single task the computer carries out with no information or items required  

---

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this lesson, given real-world analogies and structured group activities, students will be able to:

- Describe a computer program in non-technical terms  
- Write a common task as if it were a program using clear, sequential steps  
- List specific steps to produce a predictable outcome  
- Break a complex task into a main plan and subordinate steps

## üß† Introduction

### Attention Step  
Ask: ‚ÄúHave you ever followed a recipe and ended up with something totally different than what you expected?‚Äù

### Overview  
In this lesson, we‚Äôll explore what it means to write a computer program‚Äînot by learning a new language, but by doing something familiar: planning.

### Motivation  
Programming is like cooking. You have a goal, ingredients, tools, and a sequence of steps. The computer follows your instructions *exactly*‚Äîso your plan matters.

## üìã Content: Main Teaching Points

### 1. What Is a Program?

> A program is a **plan**‚Äîa list of instructions the computer follows step-by-step to accomplish a task.

Cooking comparison:
- Decide the goal (make spaghetti)
- Gather tools and ingredients
- Follow step-by-step directions
- Some steps require precision ("boil for 8 minutes")
- Others delegate ("grate the cheese")

> üí° In programming, we call a task list that combines steps and subtasks a **program**.

### 2. Activity: Recipe Breakdown

**Prompt:** ‚ÄúWrite down how to make a sandwich.‚Äù

**Demo:** Instructor performs each step *literally*.  
Examples: putting mustard on sealed bread, holding lettuce without bread, etc.

**Debrief:**  
- Why did it go wrong?  
- What would a computer do with these steps?

---

### 3. Programs Are To-Do Lists

- A program is like a to-do list with structure  
- Steps may include:
  - Simple actions
  - Small handoffs
  - Inputs and outputs

> üí° A single, specific action like ‚Äúturn on the oven‚Äù is often called a **command** or **statement**.  
>  
> üí° If a step involves handing off work to a helper with a set of items (e.g., ‚Äúdice these vegetables: onion, pepper, celery‚Äù), that‚Äôs a **function call**.  
>  
> üí° The items passed in? We call those **inputs**. What you get back? That‚Äôs your **output**.

---

### 4. Mini Exercise: Delegating a Function

**Scenario:** You ask your helper to "dice vegetables: onion, pepper, celery."

That‚Äôs a **function** with **inputs**. If they return mashed potatoes, something went wrong.

**Paired Activity:**  
- Partner 1 writes a function and gives inputs  
- Partner 2 executes *literally*

---

### 5. Programming Is Planning

- You plan before you code  
- You break the problem down  
- You test the steps  
- You can delegate parts using functions  

---

### 6. Build a Human Program

In small groups, students build a program to complete one of the following:
- Sort classmates by height  
- Make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  
- Create a morning routine  
- Build a paper airplane  

They must:
1. Write steps clearly  
2. Identify inputs  
3. Delegate at least one step as a function  
4. Run a dry run or physical test  

---

## üîÅ Wrap-Up & Reflection

**Discussion Prompts:**  
- What surprised you?  
- What happened when instructions were vague?  
- Could a computer follow your program successfully?

**Progress Prompt:**  
> ‚ÄúHow is your confidence better now than at the beginning of the lesson?‚Äù  
(Write a short journal or note.)

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

Next lesson: We‚Äôll plan programs using **pseudocode**‚Äîwriting your steps in plain English before translating them into real code.
