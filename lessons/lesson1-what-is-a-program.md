# Lesson 1: What Is a Program?

**Level:** Absolute Beginner

---

## Lesson Duration
Approx. 45–60 minutes

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain what a computer program is
- Describe the relationship between instructions and outcomes
- Recognize that programming is problem-solving
- Distinguish between the person writing the code and the computer following it

---

## Materials Needed

- A simple everyday item (toaster, coffee maker, etc.)
- Index cards or sticky notes
- Markers

---

## Introduction (5 min)

### Attention Step:
Ask: “Have you ever given someone instructions that didn’t turn out the way you expected?”

### Overview:
We’ll look at what it means to write a computer program—and how writing for computers is different from writing for people.

### Motivation:
When we write a program, we’re not just typing code. We’re solving a problem and clearly explaining the solution in a way the computer understands.

## Concept 1: What Is a Program? (10 min)

- A set of instructions that a computer follows
- The computer doesn’t know what you *meant*—only what you *said*
- Programming is about teaching a very literal student

**Example Activity:**
Ask students to write down the steps for making toast.
Then, read their steps *literally*. Point out where things go hilariously wrong.
Discuss how precision and sequencing are essential in computer logic.

---

## Concept 2: Computers Need Explicit Instructions (10 min)

- Emphasize how specific instructions prevent misunderstanding
- Highlight that code is just one way to express the solution

**Mini Exercise:**
Students pair up. One writes instructions for a task (e.g., brushing teeth), and the other acts it out *exactly*.

## Concept 3: Problem Solving Is Programming (10 min)

- Programming starts before the code
- Identify the problem
- Think through a solution
- Then translate that into code

---

## Group Activity: Build a Human Program (10–15 min)

- Students create step-by-step instructions to solve a simple problem (e.g., sorting students by age)
- Write each step on a sticky note or card
- Physically act out the steps or review the instructions together

---

## Wrap-Up & Reflection (5 min)

### Discussion Prompts:

- What surprised you today?
- How did writing out your thinking help clarify the problem?
- Could you imagine a computer doing what you asked?

### Exit Prompt:
> “How is your confidence better now than at the beginning of the lesson?”
(Add a note to your worksheet, like a journal or a snapshot.)
