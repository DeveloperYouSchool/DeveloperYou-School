## Lesson 6 Outline
**Title:** If This, Then What?  
**Level:** Absolute Beginner

---

### Lesson Duration
Approx. 45–60 minutes

---

### Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe what a condition is in programming
- Use “if… then…” phrasing to express decision points
- Practice generating logical "if" statements and matching them with actions

---

### Materials Needed
- Whiteboard or display
- Index cards or sticky notes (for group activity)
- Worksheets (optional)

---

### Introduction (5 min)
**Attention Step:** Ask: “How would rain affect your errands today?”  
**Overview:** Today we’re learning how to teach a computer to make a decision using a special phrase: *If this, then what?*  
**Motivation:** Humans make choices all the time, often without thinking. But computers need instructions that are clear, specific, and structured.

---

### Concept 1: Decisions in Everyday Life (10 min)
- Ask students to brainstorm everyday decisions
- Examples:  
  > If I’m hungry, then I’ll grab a snack.  
  > If the light turns red, then I stop.
- Emphasize that we already use “if” statements all the time

---

### Concept 2: Breaking Down the Structure (10 min)
- Write: “If it’s raining, then I’ll use an umbrella.”
- Ask: What’s the condition? What’s the action?
- Reinforce the pattern: **If** (this is true), **then** (do this)

---

### Concept 3: Conditions in Programs (10 min)
- Programs don’t guess—they follow **if this, then that**
- Just like with rain and umbrellas, programs need *clear responses*
- Examples:  
  > "If it's raining, then I'll use an umbrella."  
  > "If the password is wrong, then ask me to try again."  
  > "If the fridge is empty, then I’ll go shopping."

**Key Idea:** Computers need the “what” more than the “why.” Your job is to make that clear.

---

### Optional In-Person Group Activity (10 min)
- Each student writes an “if…” scenario on a card
- Trade cards and write a matching “then…”
- Discuss a few fun or surprising pairs with the class

---

### Wrap-Up & Reflection (5 min)
**Discussion Prompts:**
- Can you think of decisions you make every day that follow this structure?
- Why do you think this matters in programming?
- Does breaking it down into “if” and “then” make it easier to plan actions?

**Closing Thought:**  
"Computers don’t get context. They don’t ‘know better.’ But you do. That’s why we teach them."
