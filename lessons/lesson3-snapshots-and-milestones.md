# Lesson 3: Snapshots and Milestones – Tracking Change and Growth

**Level:** Absolute Beginner

## Objectives
- Describe how source control helps manage change
- Use simple analogies to explain version control
- Demonstrate how saving a snapshot helps avoid confusion
- Use messages to describe what changed and why it matters
- Connect versioning to real-life experiences (e.g., scrapbooks, journals)

## Introduction
Ask: “Have you ever looked at an old photo and thought, ‘I forgot I used to be like that’?”

Today we’re learning how developers track progress and mistakes using snapshots—just like a scrapbook or journal entry.

## Core Concepts
### What Is a Snapshot?
- A moment in time—recorded to help you go back later
- Git lets us save changes like journal entries

### Why Leave a Message?
- A photo without a caption is easy to forget
- A commit message is like your mom writing: "Jordan, 7th grade, first day of school"

### Commit = Memory
- “Commit to memory” → make it stick
- We’re committing our progress and telling the story of how we got here

### Push & Pull: Sharing the Scrapbook
- Push = putting it on the shelf
- Pull = reading someone else’s story

## Wrap-Up
Reflect on:
- What story did your code changes tell?
- What small win do you want to remember?

**Progress Prompt:**  
_“What would your snapshot from today say if someone read it a year from now?”_
