**Lesson 5 Outline**  
**Title:** Say My Name: Introducing Variables as Conversations  
**Level:** Absolute Beginner

---

### Lesson Duration
Approx. 45–60 minutes

---

### Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Define what a variable is in plain language
- Demonstrate assigning a value to a variable
- Modify a variable and describe how its value changes
- Relate variables to real-world examples (e.g., forms or labels)
- Use an interpreter shell to assign and read variable values

---

### Materials Needed
- Paper forms or worksheets with blanks (e.g., "Name: _____", "Age: _____")
- Whiteboard or screen for live demonstration
- Access to Python interpreter or simulated shell
- Sticky notes or cards labeled with variable names

---

### Introduction (5 min)
**Attention Step:** Ask: “Have you ever filled out a form that asks for your name, age, or favorite color? That’s all a variable is: a place to store something that matters to you."

**Overview:** Today we’ll learn how to store information using variables and talk to the computer by asking it to remember things.

**Motivation:** Variables help us track and reuse information—like names, scores, answers, and choices. It’s how we build conversations with a machine.

### Concept 1: What Is a Variable? (10 min)
- A variable is like a label you stick on a box or envelope
- You decide what to put in the box, and you can always change it
- Think of it like filling out a form—Name = Jordan, Age = 17

**Activity:** Have students fill out a mini form about themselves on paper. Discuss how each blank is a variable.

**Extension Metaphor:** Variables are like sticky notes. You can peel one off, write something new, and stick it back.

---

### Concept 2: Changing a Variable (10 min)
- Variables aren’t set in stone—you can change what they hold
- Example: age = 17, then later age = 18

**Mini-Activity:**  
Use sticky notes with student names and change their 'favorite color' on the fly. Emphasize that a variable holds *one* thing at a time, but can be changed.

**Silly Example:**
```python
pet = "invisible dragon"
pet = "tame velociraptor"
