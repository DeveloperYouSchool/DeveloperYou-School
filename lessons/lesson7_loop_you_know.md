## Lesson 7 Outline  
### Title: The Loop You Already Know: Doing Something Until It’s Done  
**Level:** Absolute Beginner  

---

### Lesson Duration  
Approx. 45–60 minutes  

---

### Lesson Objectives  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Describe a loop as a repeated action based on a condition or a collection  
- Identify real-world examples of looping behavior  
- Write natural-language “while” and “for each” loop patterns  
- Explain the difference between a condition-based loop and a collection-based loop  

---

### Materials Needed  
- Whiteboard or drawing space  
- Sample props: bag of items (snack bags, notecards, etc.), toy deck of cards  
- Worksheet with real-world loop framing  

---

### Introduction (5 min)  

**Affirmation Opening:**  
> “I can almost promise that each of you has performed a loop recently. You just didn’t call it that.”  

Examples:  
- “If you’ve ever emptied a grocery bag one item at a time…”  
- “If you’ve ever gone through a playlist and picked your favorite songs…”  
- “If you’ve ever sorted a stack of papers into piles…”  

You’re not learning something unfamiliar—you’re learning how to *recognize* and *name* something you already know how to do.

### Concept 1: What’s a Loop? (10 min)  
- A loop is repeating something either *while* a condition is true or *for each* item in a group  
- Emphasize it’s about flow and repetition  
- No coding needed yet  

**Activity Prompt:** Ask: “What’s something you do over and over until it’s finished?”  
Record ideas: folding laundry, feeding pets, checking homework

### Concept 2: Two Types of Loops (10 min)  
- “While something is true…”  
  - Ex: “While there are groceries in the bag, take one out.”  
- “For each item in a collection…”  
  - Ex: “For each card in the deck, check if it’s a heart.”  

Use props:  
- Have a student draw groceries from a bag  
- Use cards to simulate a “for each” search  

---

### Concept 3: Writing Loop Pseudocode (10 min)  
- Encourage natural phrasing:  
  - “While I’m hungry, keep eating.”  
  - “For each name on the list, send a thank you.”  

Students write their own examples from daily life  

---

### Wrap-Up & Reflection (5 min)  

**Discussion Prompts:**  
- Did you recognize loops in your life before today?  
- Which type feels more familiar—“while” or “for each”?  
- Why might it help to think this way when planning a task?  

**Self-Reflection Prompt (Git-style):**  
> “What’s one loop you discovered you already knew?”
