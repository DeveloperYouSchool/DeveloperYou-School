## Lesson 4 Outline  
### Title: Well, That Didn’t Work: Decisions After Failure  
**Level:** Absolute Beginner  

---

### Lesson Duration  
Approx. 45–60 minutes  

---

### Lesson Objectives  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Describe three productive responses to failure during problem-solving  
- Explain the value of documenting failed attempts  
- Identify when to experiment further vs. when to ask for help  
- Connect emotional responses to failure with the logic of try/catch or if/else structures  
- Practice mapping choices using real-world examples (non-technical)  

---

### Materials Needed  
- Index cards or printed failure scenarios  
- Whiteboard or digital workspace  
- Reflection worksheets  

---

### Introduction (5 min)  
**Attention Step:**  
> “Have you ever failed at something and thought, ‘Now what?’”  

**Overview:**  
Today we’ll learn how developers *think through failure*—and what to do next.  

**Motivation:**  
Failure isn’t the end—it’s often the start of real learning. Let’s learn to make decisions after things go wrong.  

---

### Concept 1: Failure Is Part of the Process (10 min)  

- Everyone fails; the key is what comes next  
- Failure is feedback  
- Even professional developers debug constantly  

**Mini Discussion:**  
> Think of a time something didn’t work. What did you do next?  

---

### Concept 2: Try Something Else, Ask for Help (15 min)  

- Explore examples of both strategies  
- How to experiment thoughtfully  
- When asking for help is the smartest move  

**Activity:**  
Break into pairs—give each a “failure card” (e.g., login won’t work, app crashes, wrong result).  
Ask each pair to:  
- Brainstorm 2 “try something else” actions  
- Write one helpful question they could ask someone  

---

### Concept 3: Documenting the Dead End (10 min)  

- Writing down what didn’t work saves time later  
- Helps your future self and teammates  
- Introduces the habit of meaningful comments or logs  

---

### Concept 4: Failure Feels Like Logic (10 min)  

- "If this doesn't work, then what?" mirrors coding logic  
- Gentle introduction to `try/catch` or `if/else` through real decisions  

**Example (in plain English):**
